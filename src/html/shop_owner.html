        <h4>1. Plastic Shredder</h4>
        <p>Plastic shredders are used to turn large chunks of plastic into smaller, more manageable pieces of plastic, that are easier to melt</p>
        <h4>2. Plastic Extruder</h4>
        <p>Plastic extruders take the shredded plastic and melt them into a mold</p>
        <h4>3. Spool Winder</h4>
        <p>If the plastic mould is long strings, a spool winder will wrap the plastic around a spool. The spool can then be used on a 3D printer.</p>
        <h4>4. Filament Pelletizer</h4>
        <p>The Filament Pelletizer cuts the plastic filament into small pellets that are usable for injection moulding</p>
        <h4>5. Filament Pultruder</h4>
        <p>Turns PET plastic into 3D printing filament through the process of pultrusion</p>

            <li><a href="https://reprap.org/wiki/Recyclebot#Recyclebot_v2.0.2Fv2.1">RepRapable Recyclebot</a></li>
            <p>The article discusses the Recyclebot, which is an open-source 3D printable extruder designed to convert
                plastic waste into 3D printing filament. The Recyclebot is part of the RepRap project, which aims to
                create self-replicating 3D printers that can be used to produce a wide range of objects. The Recyclebot
                allows users to convert their own plastic waste into usable 3D printing filament, reducing the need for
                new plastic production and helping to reduce waste. The design is open-source and can be easily
                reproduced and modified by anyone, making it a powerful tool for promoting sustainability and waste
                reduction in the 3D printing community.</p>

            <p>The article on all3dp.com discusses the process of 3D printing using recycled plastic waste. The use of
                recycled plastic to create 3D printing filament can help reduce the amount of plastic waste in the
                environment and decrease the need for new plastic production. There are various methods for converting
                plastic waste into 3D printing filament, including using specialized machines and DIY setups. The
                article highlights the environmental benefits of using recycled plastic in 3D printing, as well as some
                of the challenges and limitations, such as the need for a consistent supply of plastic waste and the
                need for filament to be of a high quality. Overall, 3D printing from plastic waste is a promising
                development in the fight against plastic pollution and an important step towards a more sustainable
                future.</p>
