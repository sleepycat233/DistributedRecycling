        <h2>Types of plastics</h2>
        <p>Plastics can be classified into two types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Thermosets</li>
            <li>Thermoplastics</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <u>Thermosets</u> are materials that are molded and 
            then cured into their final forms and include 
            materials like polyurethane or silicone. 
            Typically, these are <b>difficult</b> to recycle 
            by the means of mechanical recycling.</p>

        <p>
            <u>Thermoplastics</u> become pliable or workable after 
            being heated past their melting temperatures, and 
            most types of thermoplastic <b>can be </b>melted down and
            recycled. 
        </p>
        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>PET</li>
            <li>PP</li>
            <li>HDPE</li>
            <li>PLA</li>
            <li>ABS</li>
            <li>PC</li>
            <li>Nylon</li>
        </ul>
